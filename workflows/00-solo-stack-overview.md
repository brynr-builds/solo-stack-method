# Solo Stack Overview

> *Governed by AI_CONTRACT.md; contract takes precedence.*
>
> ## What Is Solo Stack Method™?
>
> A governance framework for solo developers working with AI agents. It ensures:
>
> - **Repo-as-Truth™** — Everything important lives in the repo
> - - **Explainability Before Execution™** — Plain English before action
>   - - **Intent-Preserving Code™** — Developer notes explain the "why"
>     - - **The Not-Psychic Rule™** — Ask when unclear
>       - - **Scoped Approval Gateway™** — Tiered permissions for safety
>        
>         - ---

> ## Core Components
>
> | Component | Purpose |
> |-----------|---------|
> | `AI_CONTRACT.md` | Binding rules for all AI agents |
> | `CURSOR_RULES.md` | Stabilization pass guidelines |
> | `AI_README.md` | Human-friendly orientation |
> | `/workflows/` | Step-by-step task guides |
> | `/docs/` | System documentation |
> | `/PROMPTS/` | Reusable AI prompts |
>

>
> ## Key Principles
>
> ### 1. Workflow Understanding Over Code Understanding™
>
> AI agents should understand *what you're trying to accomplish* before diving into code.
>
> ### 2. Creative-First + Completion
>
> Move fast, ship things, then stabilize.
>
> ### 3. Small, Reversible Changes
>
> Every commit should be easy to undo.

> | Fixing a bug | `03-bug-fix.md` |
> | Deploying to production | `04-deploy-to-production.md` |
> | Returning after time away | `05-return-after-time-away.md` |
> | Cleaning up code | `06-stabilization-pass.md` |
