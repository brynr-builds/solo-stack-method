# Solo Stack Manifesto™

> *One developer. One AI partner. One system of truth.*
>
> ---
>
> ## The Problem
>
> Solo developers are drowning in context-switching. You start building, then pause to check if your tools updated. You return after a week away and forget where you left off. You ask AI for help, but it doesn't know your codebase, your decisions, or your constraints.
>
> **The result:** Wasted time. Broken momentum. Half-finished projects.
>
> ---
>
> ## The Solution: Solo Stack Method™
>
> We believe solo developers deserve the same operational rigor as teams—without the overhead.
>
> ### Core Principles
>
> **1. Repo-as-Truth™**
> Everything important lives in the repository. Decisions, workflows, context—all documented where any AI agent (or future-you) can find it.
>
> **2. Explainability Before Execution™**
> Before any significant action, explain what you're doing and why—in plain English.
>
> **3. Intent-Preserving Code™**
> Code without context is a liability. Every non-trivial function gets a note explaining *why* it exists.
>
> **4. Workflow Understanding Over Code Understanding™**
> AI agents should understand how you work before they touch your code.
>
> **5. The Not-Psychic Rule™**
> Never assume. If something is unclear, stop and ask.
>
> **6. Scoped Approval Gateway™**
> Not all changes are equal. Define boundaries once, respect them always.
>
> ---
>
> ## The Stack Pulse System
>
> Your tools change constantly. **Stack Pulse** monitors the tools you actually use and surfaces only what matters—critical updates, new features, status changes.
>
> ---
>
> ## The Creative-First Principle
>
> We build to ship, not to configure. Solo Stack Method protects your creative momentum.

> ## Start Here
>
> 1. Read `AI_CONTRACT.md` — the rules that govern all AI work
> 2. 2. Read `AI_README.md` — orientation for you and your AI agents
>    3. 3. Check `/workflows/` — step-by-step guides for common tasks
>       4. 4. Set up Stack Pulse — never miss a critical tool update
>

>          6. *Solo Stack Method™ — Built for builders who ship alone but refuse to move slow.*
