# Step 2: Choose Your Tech Stack

## Goal
Select appropriate technologies based on project requirements, not trend-chasing.

## Constraints
- Decisions must be documented with reasoning
- Trade-offs must be explicit
- Stack must be compatible with solo developer capacity
- No "just because it's popular" choices
- Consider deployment target (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## Success Definition
- Tech stack documented in repo (DEV_NOTES or similar)
- Trade-offs explained for each major choice
- Dependencies listed in package.json or equivalent
- Stack is deployable on chosen platform

## What Must NOT Happen
- Do not choose technologies without justification
- Do not pick overly complex stacks for simple projects
- Do not skip documentation of decisions
- Do not ignore deployment compatibility
- Do not add unnecessary dependencies

## Compatibility
- Stack choice affects all subsequent steps
- Must work with GitHub-first workflow from Step 1
- Must support branch → PR → audit pattern
