# Step 5: Test & Validate

## Goal
Verify that built features work correctly and meet requirements.

## Constraints
- Testing must happen before audit
- Both automated and manual validation
- Edge cases should be considered
- Performance should be acceptable
- Accessibility basics should be checked

## Success Definition
- Features work as intended
- No console errors or warnings
- Responsive design functions correctly
- Navigation works throughout app
- Data flows correctly (when applicable)

## What Must NOT Happen
- Do not skip testing
- Do not ignore error states
- Do not assume "it works on my machine"
- Do not leave broken functionality
- Do not proceed to audit with known bugs

## Compatibility
- Tests must cover features from Step 4
- Must validate against context from Step 3
- Must work with tech stack from Step 2
